## Overview

This repository contains the file information of the Orti Bali Corpus,
which consists of newspaper articles from the Orti Bali newspaper.

I collected the corpus texts manually (through a classic copy-and-paste
procedure) between **26 November 2011** and **04 February 2014**, for
the news texts published in the old Orti Bali webpage between **2006 and
2013**.

It is important to note that the [current Orti
Bali](https://balitv.tv/category/news/orti-bali/) webpage does not host
the complete archive of the newspaper articles that are part of this
corpus. The old Orti Bali webpage only hosted articles published between
the stated periods above (i.e., between 2006 and 2013) and stopped
working in 2014.

For copyright reasons, I cannot share the actual text files of the
corpus, and I only use this corpus for my personal research. However, I
provide the file information (i.e., text title, file size, modification
time, etc.) in the `baliorti_file_info.tsv` file.
